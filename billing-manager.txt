Who are we looking for?
We are looking for a Billing Manager with experience in mobile applications, who will be responsible for processes related to searching, communicating with, and analyzing payment processors, preparing documents, submitting applications, obtaining MIDs, and their ongoing management.
Experience in e-commerce is a big plus.

The main process you will work with is obtaining MIDs: understanding the business structure, preparing documents, negotiating with processors, and submitting applications.
To perform the main tasks effectively, it is important to understand related processes.
These are not direct responsibilities, but understanding them is necessary for proper communication and negotiation.

We will provide all necessary knowledge and practices during work and help you master them:

Setting up and testing the connection of MIDs to CRM and payment systems.

Working with active MIDs: checking, maintaining up-to-date data and conditions, monitoring transactions.

Managing and rotating MIDs to ensure their stable operation.

Responsibilities include:

Communicating with processors.

Searching for and analyzing processors and PSPs, comparing terms, and identifying optimal solutions for the business.

Filling out and submitting applications, collecting and verifying all necessary documentation.

Maintaining a summary table for processors: updating data, fees, and comments.

What we expect:

Analytical and systematic thinking, ability to see logic and connections in processes.

Attention to detail and ability to quickly understand new information.

English level B2 or higher.

Good communication skills: polite and tactful interaction, ability to negotiate and find an approach to different people.

Proactivity and energy — not waiting for instructions, but proposing solutions and moving processes forward.

What we offer:

Remote work.

Young and friendly team.

Flexible schedule.

Full onboarding for the project.

1-month probation with clearly defined KPIs to evaluate successful completion.

Opportunity for career growth within the company.
