About us

We’re building Interview Assistant AI - a web-based AI product that helps people prepare for and go through interviews with more confidence.

Our product philosophy is Activation-First:

honest expectations from the first screen,
reduced first-time user anxiety,
safe practice before real interviews,
no hype, dark patterns, or fake metrics.
You’ll work with clear product specs, a focused scope, and a small product team that values calm, thoughtful execution.
 

What you’ll work on (Phase 1)

This role is focused on a short, clearly defined execution phase.

At a practical level, you’ll:

implement landing page and dashboard UI changes
(no redesign, no copywriting - specs provided),
add PostHog analytics on the frontend,
implement backend events for:
interview lifecycle,
AI output generation,
activation and failure states.
The goal is to ship a clean activation flow and reliable analytics, without over-engineering.
 

How we like to work

We’re looking for a developer who is comfortable working from clear specs, and who also:

points out simpler or more efficient ways to implement things,
suggests better technical approaches (especially for analytics),
surfaces tradeoffs when an implementation choice could affect timeline, cost, or risk,
asks questions if something is ambiguous.
You won’t be expected to define product direction but your technical judgment is welcome and valued.
 

What this role is not

No UX redesign
No product discovery
No experiments or A/B testing
No growth dashboards
No rewriting copy
This is a focused execution phase with clear boundaries.
 

Tech stack & experience

Must have

React (or similar SPA framework)
Backend experience (Node.js or similar)
Experience with analytics tools (PostHog, Segment, Amplitude, etc.)
Comfortable working with an existing codebase
Clear written communication
Nice to have

AI / LLM integrations
Stripe or payments experience (future phase)
 
What’s next

Phase 1 is short and activation-focused.

If things go well, there may be follow-up work later (AI model updates, API / Stripe work), but the immediate focus is Phase 1 only.
 

Please be ready to answer a few short questions after the first contact.
