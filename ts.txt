About Lexidesk

Lexidesk is a legaltech AI SaaS helping law firms capture, qualify, and convert new client inquiries via AI-powered chat and phone intake. We serve UK, US and Canadian law firms and operate in a compliance-sensitive, production-critical environment where reliability and conversion matter.

 

The Role

We’re hiring a Founding Engineer to work directly with the CTO & CEO to build and scale Lexidesk.

You’ll own large parts of the system end-to-end, make architectural and product decisions, and help shape the company at an early stage.

 

This role is for someone with high agency, strong technical judgment, and the ability to make good decisions with incomplete information.

 

 

What You’ll Do

Build and own core platform features end-to-end
Design and maintain backend services (TypeScript, NestJS)
Build and evolve the frontend (React)
Implement AI-driven workflows for chat, voice, and intake
Integrate with CRMs, calendars, and legal software
Make pragmatic architecture and product tradeoffs
Keep the system reliable, maintainable, and production-ready
 

 

What We’re Looking For

Strong full-stack experience with TypeScript, NestJS, and React
Proven ability to own systems from idea to production
Track record of shipping highly intuitive products, strong attention to detail.
High agency and strong decision-making skills
Product-oriented mindset (you care about outcomes, not just code)
Comfortable in an early-stage, fast-moving environment where customers set the pace
 

Strong Plus

Prior experience building your own startup or product
Experience with AI / LLM-powered systems
B2B SaaS or integration-heavy products
Exposure to regulated or compliance-sensitive domains
 

Why Join

Direct impact on product, architecture, and company direction
Work 1-on-1 with the founder
Remote-friendly, low-process, execution-focused team
 

Compensation

Competitive salary (stage/experience appropriate)
Monetary bonuses based on outcomes of your features
